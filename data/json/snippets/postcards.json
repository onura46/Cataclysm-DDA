        "text": "This postcard features an aerial photograph of a small town in autumn, embedded in forest and hills and next to a large river.  The trees are intense shades of orange, red, yellow, and green.  A large bridge with wide blue arches crosses over the river into the town, which seems old and barely changed from its founding.  The text on the postcard reads: \"Hello from beautiful Marquette, Iowa where the Mississippi and Wisconsin meet!\"  On the back, the sender has written a thoughtful letter detailing their vacation spent camping nearby."

        "text": "On the front of this postcard is a colorful illustration of tall apartment buildings, green trees, and a pastel blue river with a vertical-lift bridge running over it.  A large rainbow presides over the entire scene.  The text on the front says \"Greetings from Portland, Oregon!\" and on the back is a message of love from the sender to their partner, bragging about all the good food they've eaten."

        "text": "This strange postcard features a blurry, desaturated photo and text that says \"I went to Roswell, New Mexico, got [REDACTED] and then went home.\"  The sender has taken up the entire back of the card describing their adventures at the UFO festival, the interesting people they met, and how boring it was driving through the desert to get there."

        "text": "A dramatically lit photo graces the front of this postcard: an electric organ sitting on a large platform carved into a huge underground cavern.  The text on the front reads \"The Great Stalacpipe Organ in Luray Caverns, Virginia, the World's Largest Instrument!\"  On the back, the sender talks extensively about their research doing something related to weather and refers to an album of music performed on the Stalacpipe Organ that the recipient should listen to."

        "text": "The front of this postcard features a photo of a beautiful shoreline, with tall bluffs, rough green shrubbery, white buildings dotting the coast, and a vibrant blue ocean stretching out to the horizon.  In the foreground, a boy in a sailor's hat looks out over the water.  On the back, the sender describes their recent vacation cruising around the coast of Spain, although they apparently lost their expensive prescription sunglasses within minutes of leaving port."

        "text": "The picture on this postcard looks like something out of a science fiction movie.  It's a library, multiple stories tall, seemingly built inside a larger building as if to secure it even further, and windowed completely with large glass panes on the outside.  Shelves packed with books are visible from top to bottom.  The caption reads \"The Beinecke Rare Book & Manuscript Library, Yale University\".  The sheer scale of it is bewildering, and you wonder if there's any hidden knowledge there that might help counteract this apocalypse.  Anything at allâ€¦"

        "text": "This postcard features a photo of some comically impossible firearms: a Civil War-era pistol with three barrels and three hammers side by side, a rifle with extremely detailed ivory carvings and an abnormally long barrel, and a revolver with a huge cylinder that seems to hold 12 rounds instead of 6.  Something about their design tells you that they probably aren't real guns.  Taped to the back is a photo of a smiling family standing in a strange hallway that seems to go on forever in the background.  The caption on the back reads \"The House on the Rock, esoteric collections\"."

        "text": "The picture on this postcard is truly confusing: a painting of a zebra, a small mirror, and a dying potted plant in a vomit-colored room painted with oil paints on canvas, depicted in a Realist style.  The zebra is looking at the viewer, reflected a bit in the mirror, and the potted plant sits limply in the corner.  The back of the postcard reads \"The Museum of Bad Art, Boston, Massachusetts\".  The sender writes about their vacation all over New England, and impressively makes half a dozen fart-related puns in only a few sentences."
